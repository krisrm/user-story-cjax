<h1>Feature Testing with Crawljax and JavaScript</h1>
<h4>Practical Applications and Future Work</h4>
<p>This software has several interesting practical applications. Since the CrawlJax test server itself is independent of the
User Story Wiki, it can be used as a generalized engine for testing arbitrary AJAX enabled web applications. The Sample User Story
Wiki is one example of how you could visualize test progress over well defined User Stories, all on an external site - meaning
testers and developers can work independently if they so choose.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of such an approach is the ad-hoc nature of testing. Some integrated web application testing frameworks
(like <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames">Spec</a> for Ruby on Rails) allow you to write tests very quickly
from the comfort of your development environment. Software such as the Sample User Story Wiki would be more useful for 
Black Box user interface testing and visualizations of project completion based on the tests done directly on User Stories. 
A related advantage of this approach is that the testing environment becomes language/development environment agnostic (so
long as the application you are testing can be accessed entirely from the browser, with some limitations). I tested a PHP
application (WordPress), but even a simple static HTML site could have been traversed and tested.

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>More error checking. Right now if a script dies, no callback is made to the server; the test case is aborted.</li>
<li>Implement <code>Crawler.input(element,"value")</code> (in CrawlJaxServer's crawljax.js)</li>
<li>Extend the Crawler.click identification structure (right now identifies only by tag name and id)</li>
<li>Add a JavaScript code editor in place of the textarea in the Sample User Wiki</li>
<li>Better separation of test cases (allow more than 1 large block test case) from User Stories</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>A limitation of the selenium WebDriver used by Crawljax does not allow for the web browser to respond to requests for Basic or Digest HTTP Authentication</li>
<li>Testing applications with invalid Certificate Authorities (i.e. ones that warn of CA invalidity) is currently not supported</li>
<li>Clearing Test Cases sometimes doesn't remove orphaned errors from the database</li>
<li>Occasional erroneous behaviour on click from CrawlJax (I think the configuration needs to be reset in between invocations)</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of papers on testing (namely GUI testing, which CrawlJax does). There was a <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/papers/HacknerMemonICSE2008.pdf">2008 paper</a> on test generation for 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/guitar/index.php?title=GUITAR_Home_Page">GUITAR</a> (an older GUI testing framework for desktop widget toolkits developed by the same person) 
that has a similar set of execution steps (and calculates test coverage)</p></li>

User Requirements Notation language. This is a more general purpose language - the site states “the notation is intended to be 
useful for requirements specification, design, testing, maintenance, adaptation, and evolution”. I opted to specify very 
simple User Stories as links to tests, however, tests could be embedded in URNL.</p></li>
