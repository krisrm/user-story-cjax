<h1>Feature Testing with Crawljax and JavaScript</h1>
<h4>User Guide</h4>
<p>This file will walk you through installing and using the project. If you're looking for information about the <a href="PracticalApplication.html">Practical Applications and Future Work</a>, or for the <a href="DeveloperGuide.html">Developer Guide</a>, this is probably not page you want!</p>
<p>The project has 3 components: the Testing Server, the Sample User Story Wiki, and the Sample Tested Application. 
The Testing Server can be interacted with via a RESTful API, documented in the <a href="DeveloperGuide.html">Developer Guide</a>, 
and is responsible for running the test scripts on your pages. The Sample User Story Wiki is a simple application written in 
PHP designed to illustrate the integration of user stories with testing tools: you create user stories for your application, add test scripts, 
and run the tests on your application. The Sample Tested Application is just a WordPress Blog, and you would ideally use your own untested web application in place of this.</p>
<h2>Required Software</h2>
<p>
There are a number of pieces of software you need to run the project. If you only wish to run the Testing Server and post test scripts to it via other software, then a servlet container should be the only required software.
Currently, this software exists as a Proof-of-Concept. This means that, while it should theoretically work with many configurations of the required software packages, it has only been tested with one or two of them. For my development, I used:
</p>
<p><strong>Testing Server</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi">Apache Tomcat v. 7.02(Servlet container)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-older.html">Mozilla Firefox v. 3.6</a> - <em>this is the only version I tested that works with the current version of CrawlJax</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample User Story Wiki</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP (Cross-platform Apache, MySQL, PHP Stack)</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Tested Application (WordPress Blog)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP (Cross-platform Apache, MySQL, PHP Stack)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress v. 3.3.2</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Please install the required software components for the module you intend on using, and proceed to the next step</p>
<h2>Installing from Git</h2>
<p>Before you do anything else, check out the source from the <a href="https://github.com/krisrm/user-story-cjax">GitHub repository</a> 
using the <em>git clone</em> command.</p>
<h3>Testing Server</h3>
<p>Copy the TestServer.war file into your servlet container's webapps directory (may be something else under a different servlet container).
Make sure your server is started; the application should start automatically and respond to calls through the API.</p>
<p>To build from source, import the CrawlJaxServer project into <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/jee.php">Eclipse for JavaEE</a>. 
You'll need to set up a server to deploy the project to (via File, New, Other: Server), and then set the project's server to the one you just created.</p>
<h3>Sample User Story Wiki</h3>
<p>To install the User Story Wiki, simply copy the folder to your htdocs directory where you installed XAMPP. Ensure Apache and MySQL are running.
Create a new MySQL database called "wiki" and make sure at least one user has access to it. 
Update the file "db.php" with your database name/username/password.</p>
<h3>Sample Tested Application</h3>
<p>To test the same application I used when developing, just grab the latest version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress</a>.
 In practice though, you should write your own application and then point the User Story Wiki/Testing Server at localhost/application (for example)
 for testing.
